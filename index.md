## About Me

I am currently a Georgia Tech student in the Master of Computer Science program specializing Machine Learning. I recieved my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from UC Irvine at 2019 and subsequently worked in industry for a few years. Utilizing the elective path at UCI to take courses in the ML field, I became passionate to further explore this powerful and impactful field here at Tech.
